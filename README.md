# Arduino DuckyScript Payloads

Convert DuckyScript payloads to Arduino code for microcontrollers with HID support.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a convenient resource of converted DuckyScript payloads into Arduino code. DuckyScript is a scripting language used primarily for injecting keystrokes into computers, often associated with the USB Rubber Ducky, a popular keystroke injection tool. By converting DuckyScript payloads to Arduino code, this resource allows users to emulate keyboard and mouse input via USB using microcontrollers such as the Arduino Pro Micro, which have Human Interface Device (HID) support.

## Features

- Converted DuckyScript payloads to Arduino code compatible with microcontrollers with HID support.
- Emulate keyboard and mouse actions via USB using Arduino boards.
- Easily customize and modify converted Arduino code to suit specific requirements.
- Compatible with a wide range of Arduino development environments and libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed on your system.
- Arduino board with HID support, such as Arduino Pro Micro.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/duckyscript-to-arduino.git
Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.

## Usage

Open the converted Arduino code in the Arduino IDE.
Select the appropriate board and port from the Arduino IDE menu.
Upload the code to your Arduino board.
Connect the Arduino board to the target computer via USB.
The Arduino board will emulate the keyboard and mouse actions specified in the DuckyScript payload.
